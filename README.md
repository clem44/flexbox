# flexbox
This is a small program I built in second year. Its a simply calculator for determining the cost of cardboard boxes based 
on their estimated dimensions. 

The scenario was to build an application to be used by the customer for ordering boxes. They would only be required to 
set the box height, width, length and box grade. The application would figure out the remaining specifications based on those.
